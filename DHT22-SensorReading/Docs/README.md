# DHT22 Sensor Demo – Arduino Nano v3

This project demonstrates how to read temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor using the Arduino Nano v3. It is designed for educational use, sensor calibration practice, and reproducible documentation. Sensor readings are displayed in real-time on a 0.96" I2C OLED screen.

## 🧩 Features
- Reads temperature and humidity from DHT22
- Displays real-time data on a 0.96" I2C OLED
- Modular code structure for easy reuse
- Includes calibration notes and troubleshooting guide

## 📦 Components Used
